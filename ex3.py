# exercise 3: numbers and math
# math symbols:
# + - plus
# - - minus
# / - slash
# * - asterisk
# % - percent
# < - less-than
# > - greater-than
# <= - less-than-equal
# >= - greater-than-equal
# code follows

print "I will now count my chickens:"
# addition followed by division of the sum by 6
print "Hens", 20.0 + 30.0 / 6.0 
# subtracts 25 from 100, multiplies the result by 3 and div by 4
print "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

print "Now i will count the eggs:"
# additions, subtractions, divisions and percent
print 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

print "is it true that 3+2 < 5-7"
# does two math operations then compares if the first is smaller 
print 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0

# basic subtraction and addition, shows result
print "what is 3 + 2", 3.0 + 2.0
print "what is 5 - 7", 5.0 - 7.0

print "oh, that's why it's false"

print "how about some more"

# returns true or false for bigger or smaller number
print "is this greater", 5.0 > -2.0
# true/false if number is exaclty -2 or larger
print "is this greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0
# true/false if number is exactly -2 or smaller
print "is this less or equal", 5.0 <= -2.0
